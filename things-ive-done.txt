For (vmware fusion) VM only:
I have installed a special script for hard-coding monitor resolutions for the vm display.
  * You can find a wiki page for this.
I have installed a special config that makes the default resolution the one for my imac.
  * It's from the same page as above

For Flash Drive only:
I had to change the order of the hooks in /etc/mkinitcpio.conf
  * Move "block" right behind "udev" in order for the root partition to be identified.
    * If available, see root/etc/mkinitcpio.conf

For installing on mac directly:
I had to create a fat16 partition of about 300M for the boot partition, and flag it with (boot, esp)
I had to mount it to /boot in the main partition
When installing arch onto the main partition, I had to verify that it also noticed the mount at /boot, and that it installed the linux images onto the boot partition
I had to install the package intel-ucode, and verify that it placed the intel-ucode image into my boot partition
I had to manually install the systemd-boot image to the boot partition using "bootctl --path=/boot install"
I had to get the partition UUIDs using "blkid" 
I had to manually edit the bootloader config files, by:
  * Adding a loader at /boot/loader/entries/arch.conf
    * If available, see root/boot/loader/entries/arch.conf
    * I pointed the loader to my main partition using the partition UUID found previously
    * I also included the intel-ucode image as part of the configuration
  * Pointing the main loader to my new loader config
    * If available, see root/boot/loader/loader.conf
I had to install drivers for my iMac's graphics, which happened to be covered by the 'mesa' package.
  * My graphics card was a gen4 ATI/AMD card, and I found this by running "lspci | grep VGA"

For every case:
I have installed a special script for GTK3 that scales everything in GDK up to 2
  * If available, see root/etc/profile.d/gdkscale.sh
  * I may need something similar for Qt5
I have installed a special driver for the trackpad, xf86-input-mtrack-git
  * It requires an xconf configuration file, which I put at /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-mtrack.conf
  * If available, see root/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-mtrack.conf
I have .Xresources, .xinitrc, etc. in my home directory
I have enabled dhcpd.service and xdm.service
  * Run "systemctl enable dhcpcd.service" and "systemctl enable xdm.service" with root privileges
I installed ttf-font-awesome, ttf-dejavu, adobe-source-han-sans-otc-fonts, and adobe-source-han-serif-otc-fonts
  * The latter two are fonts for CJK characters
I installed cower and pacaur to make installation from the AUR easier
  * There has been at least one case where I could not easily uninstall stuff from the AUR
I installed polybar from AUR
I installed redshift, and manually set up a config, and placed it into i3
  * If available, see .config/redshift
I installed lm_sensors
  * There are guides online for setup
  * The short version is "sudo sensors-detect", say yes to everything, and save the config
I installed bluez and bluez-utils to get support for bluetooth
  * I enabled bluetooth.service, as well
  * I paired my keyboard by obtaining the MAC address while in macOS, and using it to connect.
  * I paired my trackpad using a similar methodology as above, but it required a little more:
    * First, I set pairable, discoverable and pair to on
    * Then, I typed in 'trust <mac>' before the trackpad was unplugged from my computer (i.e. it's bluetooth antenna was not on)
    * Then, I unplugged the device and tapped it to coerce it into bluetooth activity.
    * As soon as I saw the device in bluetoothctl, I hit enter to trust the device
    * I then quickly attempted to pair the device
    * On a successful pairing, the device actually disconnected
    * Upon a manual connect, the trackpad successfully remained active and usable
  * I enabled bluetooth to boot on startup, by setting AutoEnable=true in the bluetooth main config
  * If available, see root/etc/bluetooth/main.conf
I install s-tui from AUR
I installed alsa-utils, alsa-firmware and alsa-plugins for audio
  * So far, I still have not yet found a way to get audio to play from the built in speakers
  * The alsa state services also fail to launch, reporting missing state and conf files
  * Before I installed pulseaudio for my headphones, I saw no volume controls, unless I ran some kind of command from the command line, like sound-test. After that, I would only see a PCM volume bar, which is not the master volume bar, and its adjustment did not provide volume.
I installed pulseaudio-bluetooth and pulseaudio-alsa
  * I noticed that this changed the display of polybar, and also I gained a master volume bar in alsamixer
  * After doing this, I paired my headphones, by first trusting and then pairing the headset in bluetoothctl
  * After paired and connected, I could get audio through the headphones

TODOs
* I need to play around with compton to get the visual artifacts to go away
* I need to play around with my graphics drivers, if they are the cause of the above
* I need to configure the IO stuff for my flash card, in order to minimize damage to it
* I need to make sure wifi works
* I need to make sure the webcam works
* I need to figure out why the headphones sometimes have very slow playback
* I need to figure out why I can't control the built in audio
* I need to finish configuring trackpad drivers, or find new ones that work.
* I need to create a script that sends brightness levels to /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness
* I need to look over the Mac page on the arch wiki to see if there is anything else I can bring over
